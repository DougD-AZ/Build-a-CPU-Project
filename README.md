# Build-a-CPU-Project
This repository contains all the code for all projects in the book "Mission Impossible - Build your own CPU from Scratch".  Projects are organized by chapter.  

Each project folder is a complete FPGA project with all files necessary to build the project on Alchitry Au FPGA board.  The constraints files need to be updated to run on the Au v2 boards.
