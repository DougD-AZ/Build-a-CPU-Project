# Build-a-CPU-Project
This repository contains all the code for all projects in the book "Mission Impossible - Build your own CPU from Scratch".
Each project folder is a complete FPGA project with all files necessary to build the project on Alchitry AU FPGA board.
Projects are organized by chapter.  All projects are configured for use with the Alchitry Au FPGA board.   The constraints files need to be updated to run on the Au v2 boards.
